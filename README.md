# Infinite-CCU-VR-Base (NOT READY YET, WIP!)
**Comes with GorillaLocomotion bult in and setup for networking**

Uses EOS and custom systems to achieve infinite CCU for free!

> I Highly reccomend you to read through the quick start guide bellow before you jump in!

## Important Notices Before Usage!
It is recommended not to change any EOS components as it may put you and others at risk of leaking IP's

Make sure this option on the EOS Transport (NetworkManager GameObject) is set to Force Relays else IP's may be leaked (including yours)

Not importing mirror properly? Please do NOT use the latest version from the asset store as it wont work. Instead get it from here as a .unitypackage and import it into your project.

> ⚠️ Just in case, I am not responsible for IP leaks, TOS breaking or other stuff similair, as you need to read the EOS TOS first!
